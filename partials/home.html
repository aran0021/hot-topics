    <p>Gold has been accepted among communities as a stock trade, at around 500 B.C. and the values assessment has enabled commerce for centuries. At the same time, some economists held liable the phenomenon of deflation and the Great Depression, to the currency system based on the gold. John Maynard Keynes, the author of the new theory the fiat system, proposed that the government should be responsible for providing legal tender paper currency, based on statistical indicators of the economy. Analyzing the price of gold, from 1878 to 1932, there were no changes in its value. It was stable $20.67 USD per ounce according to Reuters Data Stream, World Council, Gold Silver Worlds and Only Gold. Therefore, the information on which this theory supports its thesis may not be reliable. According to Gary Richardson from the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, the banking system in the United States in 1920 was 8,000 banks with regulations from the Federal Reserved System, and another 16,000 out of the structure of this system, without federal policy. Understanding this information with simple math, there were 24,000 banks, 66% of them without feasible measures. In Nebraska only for every 1,000 people there was a bank, at that time the population was 1.3 million. It was the perfect environment for an enormous economic catastrophe. The lack of responsible measures, from the federal government, lead to the Great Depression. Now let us comprehend the role of the administrative governance with the Fiat System.</p>

    <h1>GMO Food</h1>
    <p>Genetically modified organism, where develop to met people needs for food. But these activities had been since 12,000 years ago, always trying to enhance breeding. The first plant produce with a direct genetically modified DNA method was in 1983. Natural grown vegetables, fruits, cereals were created to improve the quality of these products, and not just that, also making them resistance to insects, tolerance to herbicides, heat, cold, drought and crop yield. In different parts of the world there are groups in favor and against. Let us understand both sides of this issue. People in opposition to GMO, argued that allergies have increase in population. Among a group ranging from 18 year and younger, was belief to have increase reactions between 1997 and 1999, to 3.4 percent and with a high of 5.1 percent from 2009 to 2011. Although there is not conclusive evidence that could sustain this statement, Harvard studies show no difference or causes linked specifically with GMO. Another reason for the opposition is that Gene modified products may be the cause for Cancer. This incident was cause by a misleading journal paper, which was rejected after finding made by a peer-review process. The review encounter that this studies were conducted with not enough rats, and just a specific cluster of rats where vulnerable to Cancer. Now let us see the other side of this controversial topic.</p>

    <h1>The View of World in 2100</h1>
    <p>In the Quantum effect, superconductor are placed within the magnetic field divert the field entirely, such that none of the field passes through the object itself.<br> Thinness of the superconductor coating in the quantum locking allows for the magnetic field to get through wherever there exist molecular structure imperfection in the superconductor. This phenomenon gives rise to the "flux tubes", which pass through the inert crystal sapphire wafer and "trap" it in midair. This trapping provides the typically wobbly "levitation" characteristic of the Meissner effect a stiffer quality.<br> This means that in the future, transportation and electric fields may be the answer to move people around the globe. Taking this advantages could propel a world without fossil fuel.</p>
